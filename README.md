# Reelsense-Movie-Recommendation-System
A robust recommendation engine that combines Collaborative Filtering (SVD) and Content-Based Filtering (Cosine Similarity) to provide personalized movie suggestions. This hybrid approach overcomes the "Cold Start" problem and enhances recommendation accuracy by leveraging both user rating history and movie metadata (genres).🚀 Key FeaturesHybrid Architecture: Weighted integration of Matrix Factorization (SVD) and text-based similarity.Collaborative Filtering: Uses scikit-surprise to predict ratings based on latent user-item factors.Content-Based Filtering: Utilizes TF-IDF and Linear Kernel (Cosine Similarity) on movie genres to find similar items.Optimized Performance: Implements pre-computed indexing and vectorization for fast real-time lookups.Evaluation Module: Includes custom metrics for RMSE, MAE, Precision@K, and Recall@K.🛠️ Tech StackPython 3.8+Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and efficient vector operations.Scikit-Learn: TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity calculation.Surprise Library: Implementation of the SVD algorithm.📊 Methodology1. Collaborative Filtering (SVD)We employ Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose the user-item interaction matrix. This captures latent features (hidden patterns) in user behavior, allowing us to predict how a user would rate a movie they haven't seen yet.2. Content-Based FilteringWe analyze movie metadata (specifically genres) using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). A Cosine Similarity matrix is generated to quantify how similar any two movies are.3. The Hybrid EngineThe final recommendation score ($S_{final}$) is a weighted average of the two components:$$S_{final} = \alpha \cdot S_{SVD} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot S_{Content}$$Where $\alpha$ (alpha) is a tunable hyperparameter (default 0.8) controlling the balance between popularity/rating (SVD) and content similarity.
